## Implementation:

This platform is implemented using Django framework with HTML, CSS and JavaScript for frontend
and employ ORM (Object Relational Mapping) for connecting backend and very flexible which help
us to migrate different database without changing it query and work efficiently.

This Project consist Four Major Part:
```
1) User:
This component plays important role in our project as, it can create, delete and share the
code snippet with other user and using our platform.
```
```
2) Search:
This component can help us to search different snippet in our system that has been
published by the user.
```
```
3) Snippet:
It provides the container where all the codes have been uploaded by the users and provides
functionality of submitting the code in the different formats. It also help user generate
unique URL, which can be shared and accessed directly.
```
```
4) Anonymous Upload:
This component provide functionality of uploading the codes to platform anonymously. And
user does not need to register to our system and work without any problem.
```

# Future Scope:

```
1 Later this system can become major platform for sharing of code and will become social
media platform for developer, where they can share awesome work.
```
```
2 Integration of application with system like: Github or Bit Bucket, where user can take snap
shot of their code and send the for verification without exposing to the system.
```
```
3 Sharing of code will become more strong, as we are using base64 with Md5 for generating
the secure sharing URL. Later we can use SHA-64, SHA-128 or SHA-256 to make it more
secure.
```
# Conclusion:

Using this system, we can create popular social platform, where developer and programmer can
their work without side world and shared code can also solve problem of other developer which
they were facing. It can become bible of codes and application will be designed with aesthetic and
eyes pleasing User Interface.
